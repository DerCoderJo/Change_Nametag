If you want to show the name from the Player in the Nametag, you just need to write @s, it will automatically replace it with the Players name.

With this Addon you can change the nametag from a Player, with the `/tag` command. All what you need to do is to write `/tag <player> add "nametag:<new-nametag>`".

`@s` in the Nametag it will automatically replace with the Players name and with `\\n` you can create a new line.


Examples:
- /tag @p add "nametag:my new nametag"
- /tag @a[tag=moderator] add "nametag:§r§8[§9Moderator§8] @s"
